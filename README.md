# MedfordCharities
This project was from CS356 Cloud Computing, and is a cloud deployed website that uses Google Cloud features to display and add local charity listings using Jinja2 and Python, within a Docker container.

The website uses a (now unavailable) Google Cloud API token to query Google Maps locations, and display a map and listing of local charities available in Medford, Oregon. Most files are commented on what they do, or are self explanitory based on naming schemes.

A demo video of the website in action is available on request.
